            <h3>About the Project</h3>
   
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>This web interactive fiction reframes the Ukraine war from the perspective of Russian citizens. Are they cowards for fleeing the country, or are they victims to Russia dictatorship and propaganda? Many who fled the country were against the war, but felt powerless to have any influence on it. Stuck between the Kremlin regime and the rejection of the world, where can they turn to for help?</p>

            <p>So far, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have closed their border to Russian tourists who out of concern for security threats. </p>
            <p>What would the correct course of option be?</p>
