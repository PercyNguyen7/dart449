        <h3>As We May Think</h3>
        <div >
        <p>First, I appreciate the fact that mankind agreed on a new purpose for science and technology after world war 2, instead of getting carried away and focusing that science on military purposes. Perhaps the mass of victims was the main inspiration for this change, for one death is one too many for a meaningless war. Although one could also argue that the new war is one of cyber espionage and digital sabotage, yet this war of digital information is far less violent than one of blood and tragedy. 

            Second, reading this text with hindsight from the future makes it more impressive as it is an accurate depiction of what is essentially a modern computer. The computer is indeed an incredible extension of the human mind. It is as said, not only an extension of our memory but also one that can amplify our knowledge. With the invention of computer hypertext, and eventually Wikipedia, the encyclopedia that Bush envisioned. The only perspective that he fails to mention is the danger of how distracting this device can be. In the hands of well meaning scholars such as Vannevar Bush, it will no doubt be a great tool that amplifies one’s knowledge. However it is noted that not all minds are interested in elevating humanity. Some companies are only concerned in revenue by entrapping their users through addictive design, not taking into consideration the well-being of their audience. Others manipulate for political means, pushing their blatant agenda on unsuspecting users.

        <h3>The Virtual Revolution</h3>
        <div >
        <p>The first episode of Virtual Revolution retells the web’s root in libertarianism and counter culture stemming from the Well, the modern equivalent of Facebook. Although the original purpose of the net is nothing short of empowering the public and the individual, the capitalist nature of our society eventually leads to big corporations' domination over the internet. 
        </p>
        <p> This is deeply reflective of human nature to follow current trends and convenience. Much like how a pedestrian is drawn into a public art shows or concerts, popularity draws curiosity and demonstrates credibility. In a sense, popular social platforms are mini hubs of the net by itself as it features all sources of content, making it relevant to every and any topic. The platform needs not to specialize but rather to accommodate their users and their content. On Youtube, an amateur chef may find cooking courses the same way that an investor learns more about stocks. Youtube, Instagram, Twitter and the likes are merely a more complex, visually and textually engaging form of Wikipedia as their contents are created and challenged by the people. There is nothing inherently bad about the public being able to voice their opinion and create their own content. </p>

        <p> However, one may argue that while wikipedia as a digital encyclopedia focuses on production of knowledge, the other platforms lean more towards the production of knowledge embedded in entertainment. In a world of digital space and short attention spans, contents must first be entertaining before they can be viral. A content that focuses on user amusement then cannot be objective and factual. Users then must understand and realize that the information they consume on these social medias are not made in the interest of education and therefore they are not to be taken at face value. Failure to realize this fact is what leads to the disinformation and misinformation crisis that we now face.</p>

        <h3>The Social Dilemma</h3>
        <div >
            <p>The documentary The Social Dilemma raises negative aspects of social media such as disinformation and psychological manipulation. One of the facts presented in this documentary stood out to me: “Fake news spread six times faster than true news”. This fact makes perfect sense as fake news titles are usually phrased to appeal to the emotions of the audience and their interest for personal gains. Lately I have been stumbling through a number of “Elon Musk promises to give half his fortunes to Canada '' or “Elon Musk Quantum AI Investment Opportunity” advertisements with their thumbnail featuring the Tesla owner multi millionaire. It is sad how these scam advertisements have been circulating youtube for months now without any repercussions. On top of these primitive edits come Deep Fake videos with much more credibility and insidious intentions that will be the perfect weapon on social media platforms for they are short, quick and scandalous videos. Even the Elon Musk chinese doppelganger was no other than a product of deep fake.
            </p>
        <p>
            While I agree with the main arguments raised by the documentary, I disagree with how the documentary unnecessarily dramatizes the problem by putting fictional characters and situations into play. For instance, the family members racing to retrieve their phone during dinner is overly dramatic. I would have loved factual information, surveys and data to be shown. This is a recurring problem of Netflix docudrama: a focus on entertainment instead of absolute truth. Netflix documentaries usually dance around the subject, tease the audience with pieces of information and extend the playtime far longer than it should be. One might say the documentary itself is a possible product of misinformation as it adds a layer of entertainment of fictitious scenarios on top of the truth.

        <h3>Everything is a Remix</h3>
        <div >
            <p>While there are certainly some inventions that are more original than others, most things that were created are forcibly inspired from the past. Everything that we consume becomes a part of our identity and paradigm. We, as human beings, are also products of the past and current products of the present. The culture, the space, and the people that we choose to engage with are determining factors that establish ourselves. 

            </p>
        <p>
            I absolutely agree with Ferguson that to learn something means to understand the logic of it through copying. One may only transform and remix it into a better product when one has thoroughly understood the original product and the social construct of what constitutes a good product. And then it is merely a process of remixing until the desired result is reached.

        </p>

       <p>Starting from scratch and working your way to success is unnecessary. Why start from scratch and reinvent the wheel when one can rely on existing successful recipes? Others have failed so that one may avoid making the same mistake. This saves both time and resources, rendering the creation process significantly faster and far more effective. Hence why many movies have sequels to their original movie as it is much easier to build on top of a proven successful idea. Following the footsteps of our predecessors is a wise path to walk on. The only creative process is adding an additional layer of personal thoughts and depth that subscribes to the current trend and technical standard of modern day. Remixing is therefore good, for it continuously reinvents the culture, the landscape, and the quality of our lives. It is hard to get bored when everything and everyone remixes and evolves.
